OTP Verification System (Python Capstone Project)
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The OTP Verification System is a Python-based application designed to verify user identity through a secure One-Time Password (OTP) sent via email. It generates a random 6-digit OTP, simulates email delivery, and validates user input for authentication. This project demonstrates the use of Python for real-world applications in security, automation, and user authentication.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Develop a system that:

Generates a random 6-digit OTP.

Sends the OTP to a userâ€™s email address (simulated or via SMTP).

Prompts the user to input the received OTP.

Verifies whether the entered OTP matches the generated one.

Grants or denies access based on verification results.

Handles incorrect entries gracefully with retry options and user-friendly prompts.
